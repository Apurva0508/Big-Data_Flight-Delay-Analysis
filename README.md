## Big-Data_Flight-Delay-Analysis
Airline Delay Analysis And Predictions using Big Data tool
#Introduction
Airline delays have a significant impact on both customers and airlines. By analyzing the causes of delays and predicting potential delays, airlines can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce operational costs, and improve efficiency. This project aims to utilize PySpark and machine learning models to analyze flight delay data and build models for predicting and mitigating delays.
#Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization on historical airline delay data.
Identify trends and contributing factors to flight delays.
Develop predictive models to estimate delays using machine learning techniques.
Provide actionable insights for airlines to optimize operations, minimize delays, and improve customer satisfaction.

#About Dataaet
The dataset used in this project is the US Airline Delay Data (2004-2019), which was sourced from the Harvard Dataverse. This dataset includes comprehensive records of flight delays across the United States.

#Data Ingestion

Load large historical flight delay datasets using PySpark for distributed data processing.
Ensure proper schema inference and handle various data formats (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
#Data Preprocessing

Handle missing data through techniques like imputation or removing incomplete rows.
Convert date and time columns into timestamp formats.
Filter out irrelevant records (e.g., canceled flights) and remove duplicate entries.
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform statistical summaries to understand data distribution (e.g., mean, median).
Visualize trends and patterns across features such as airlines, time of day, or weather conditions.
Analyze correlations between factors like weather, time, airport, and delays.
Feature Engineering

Extract time-based features such as day, month, year, and hour to capture temporal patterns.
Create lag features based on historical flight delay data for the same route or airline.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., airline names) into numerical format using one-hot or label encoding.
Address class imbalance (e.g., fewer delayed flights) through techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Model Selection and Training

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Use a confusion matrix to analyze true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Ensure the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting.
Model Testing and Prediction

Apply the trained model to predict flight delays on new or unseen data.
Fine-tune the model based on performance on the test set and consider real-time prediction integration.
